    <p>Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world . Nelson Mandela As rightly quoted, education is indeed avery powerful tool used by Nations to strengthen their human resources so as to reach the pinnacle of success in their developmental aims. Indus Public School, over the years has been relentlessly attempting to deliver it’s best in the field of education. Here education is not restricted to mere textbooks, but is a complete package aimed at holistic learning resulting in complete evolution of the body mind and soul. Real education provides the confidence and courage to face the challenges in life. Its about teaching the child How to think rather than What to think. Equipping the child with adequate life skills, knowledge and wisdom to sustain himself or herself in the tough world. Childhood is a state of mind which ends the moment a puddle is first viewed as an obstacle instead of an opportunity. The most significant phase of human life, childhood, is known for its naivety, innocence and simplicity. Neuroscience states that neurons are highly active between 0 to 8 years of age, thus resulting in formation of habits, acquiring moral values and etiquette and developing concepts for a lifetime. Therefore real education needs to be imparted in these years so that the roots are strong enough to bring up an intellectual youth having good habits, values and etiquette. Schooling at this age needs to be very effective in instilling moral values of honesty, integrity and truthfulness along with self confidence and self esteem. From kindergarten, we have been laying the foundation and have seen our students passing out in XII as confident responsible adults ready to face challenges in their lives. Holistic education is the need of the hour to build a strong nation of youth equally strong in body mind and soul. We at Indus have been pursuing our modest endeavors to contribute in producing a new generation of adults physically strong, mentally balanced and emotionally stable. </p>
